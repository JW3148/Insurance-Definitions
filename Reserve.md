Reserve
-
- An amount of money earmarked for a specific purpose. 
- unearned reserve + loss reserve
- Insurers establish unearned premium reserves and loss reserves indicated on their balance sheets. 
- Unearned premium reserves show the aggregate amount of premiums that would be returned to policyholders if all policies were canceled on the date the balance sheet was prepared. 
- Loss reserves are estimates of outstanding losses, loss adjustment expenses (LAEs), and other related items. Self-insured organizations also maintain loss reserves.

Loss Reserve/outstanding claims reserve
- the calculation of the required reserves for a tranche of general insurance business.
- represent the money which should be held by the insurer so as to be able to meet all future claims arising from policies currently in force and policies written in the past.
- Methods of calculating reserves in general insurance are different from those used in life insurance, pensions and health insurance since general insurance contracts are typically of a much shorter duration. Most general insurance contracts are written for a period of one year, and typically there is only one payment of premium at the start of the contract in exchange for coverage over the year. 
- Reserves are calculated differently from contracts of a longer duration with multiple premium payments since there are no future premiums to consider in this case. 
- The reserves are calculated by forecasting future losses from past losses.


Method to calculate loss reserve/claim reserve
- the chain-ladder method and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.
- The chain-ladder method, also known as the development method, assumes that past experience is an indicator of future experience. Loss development patterns in the past are used to estimate how claim amounts will increase (or decrease) in the future.
- The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses both past loss development as well as an independently derived prior estimate of ultimate expected losses

Case Reserve
- the estimate of unpaid claims
- an estimate of the amount for which a particular claim will ultimately be settled or adjudicated
- Case reserves are those set aside for each individual claim -- Each "case" has its own "case reserve."
- they are reserves for individual known claims that are reviewed on a case-by-case basis
- also knowns as loss reserve(not sure)




IBNR (Incurred but not reported)
- the amount owed by an insurer to all valid claimants who have had a covered loss but have not yet reported it. 
- loss happened but not yet reported
- The loss reserve value established in recognition of the total liability for
future payments on losses which have occurred but have not yet been
reported to the insurance company; 
- also include expected future development on claims already reported; 
- for claims made coverage, the term IBNR represents the
liability for unpaid claims that have been incurred and reported ,but not fully
developed.
